While last month was busy with Software Freedom Day and Guest In Town events,

This Month we have again lots of activities, starting with a special guest at the BLUG Meeting
Mattias Wecksten from Sweden will introduce his Introductory Workshop on Forensic Filesystem Analysis

The BLUG Meeting is to short for the whole workshop, but we will get an overview of what the workshop is about, and why it is interesting.

Mattias is interested to meet people from the Beijing Security community, so if that is you, please join us and say hello.

(Update: If you are wondering what happened to Xuedi, he will be in beijing, but not on the 14th. He'll join us for a Chuan'r dinner instead)
